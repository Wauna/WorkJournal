# WorkJournal
This is a Google Docs Script that can be used to tranform a Google Doc into a work Journal.  The Script adds a menu "Work Journal" to the Google Docs interface. 

**The workflow I use is as follows: **
1) At the beginning of the month, I create a new Journal.  This stubs out a page for each work day of the month. 
2) Each day I start by looking at my previous day. Copying over my work efforts, and then setting goals for the day. I convert the daily goals to checkboxes. This is manual because I cannot figure out how to make them "CheckBoxes" in the script. 
3) For meetings I simply enter the @ symbol and then meetings ->  this brings up meeting block and allows me to take notes for meetings.
